# FCA-Lattice-and-Graph-Microservice
This microservice provides an API for creating and managing FCA (Formal Concept Analysis) lattices and related graphs in a Neo4j database. It supports multi-user operations, ensuring each lattice and its associated graph are unique to each user. The service includes functionalities for building lattices from given dimensions, attributes, and associations, storing the resulting graph in Neo4j, searching for concepts, updating lattices, and maintaining logs of all operations performed.
